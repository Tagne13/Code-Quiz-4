# Code-Quiz-4

## Description

The purpose of this application is to test students on their knowledge of JavaScript. In a multiple choice format, student will be presented with a question and select the correct answer. If selected incorrectly, time will be deducted from the running quiz time resulting in a lower overall score on the quiz. Students will be able to save their scores in order to try and beat the top score. The application combines basic JavaScript with HTML and CSS code to create an interactive, functional application.
